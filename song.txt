Hey there you, looking for a brighter season (yeah)
Need to lay your burden down (haha)
Hey there you, drowning in a helpless feeling (dutty, young blood sucka)
Buried under deeper ground (uh)
Yeah, okay, uh, uh, yeah

I seem depressed, always being bothered, never less
Keeping me out of prison and putting me to the test
They ask me what is happiness, you write it on a check
Or you feel it on the sweat, when your dick is in the breast, huh
